1.

Coarsely chop chocolate and place in a small metal bowl. Simmer water in a pot and place the bowl over the pot so it hangs over the water. Melt the chocolate while stirring.

2.

Cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds. Place the pod, seeds and 500 ml (approximately 2 cups) milk in a pot. Bring to a simmer, immediately remove from heat and let steep for 15 minutes.

3.

Separate the eggs. Whisk yolks in a bowl with the remaining milk until smooth (save egg whites for another use). Add cornstarch and stir until smooth.

4.

Slowly pour the still-warm vanilla milk through a sieve into the yolks, stirring constantly. Pour egg-milk mixture back into the pot.

5.

Over medium heat, stirring constantly, bring milk mixture to a boil and cook for 1-2 minutes.

6.

Stir condensed milk and melted chocolate into the milk mixture.

7.

Fill glasses with pudding, cover and chill overnight.

8.

The granita (semifreddo) can be prepared the day before, if desired. Coarsely crush coffee beans in a mortar. Combine 400 ml (approximately 1 1/2 cups) water, sugar and coffee beans in a pot and bring to a boil while stirring. Cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes.

9.

Strain through a sieve into a shallow dish. Stir in the liqueur.

10.

Place dish in the freezer for 4 hours. Rake the coffee mixture every 15-30 minutes with a fork to form small, frozen crystals. To serve, place a scoop of granita on top of each serving pudding. Sprinkle to taste with additional liqueur. Serve immediately.
